# Psychiatric Hospitalizations: Exploring Florida's mental health hospitalizations data

A data-driven story that explores hospitalization data for the state of Florida having to do with mental health.

## Data

- Data pulled from [FLHealthCharts](https://t.me/thecvdbot), which is supported by the Florida Department of Health.

- Data spans from 1998-2017.

- Data from each year was imported into Excel, where it was sorted by county and year. 

## Research Questions

After seeing the CSV worksheet, I now had a basis for creating my research questions:
1. What county has the highest rate of hospitalization?
2. What county has the lowest rate of hospitalization?
3. What factors determine rate of hospitalization? (demographic, geographical region, etc)
4. Were rates affected by major US events? (hurricanes, US elections, policy change, etc)


## Code

This project was built using D3.js, HTML, and CSS.
