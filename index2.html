      There is a not new but increasing in presence, lethal epidemic in North America that is quickly catching up with us and could potentially be contributing to the recently<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/us-life-expectancy-declines-again-a-dismal-trend-not-seen-since-world-war-i/2018/11/28/ae58bc8c-f28c-11e8-bc79-68604ed88993_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.7a31076754a0"> decreased U.S. life expectancy</a>: <b>mental health</b>. According the <a href="http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/201711/2018_the_state_of_mh_in_america_-_final.pdf"> State of Mental Health in American 2018 report</a>, there are several key statistics we need to consider: 18% of adults have a mental health condition, which is over 43 million Americans. Nearly half of these people have a co-occurring substance abuse disorder. Another 9.6 million experience suicidal ideation. Over the last five years rates of severe youth depression have increased, and over 1.7 youth did not receive treatment.

    <p>
      All of these numbers are increases from years previous at the national level. Where does Florida stand in these efforts? According to the same report, Florida is high up at rank no. 10 in mental health problems and substance use problems and is also ranked 44 in how easy it is to access mental health care. Yikes.

<h2>WHAT ABOUT FLORIDA?</h2>
    <p>
      Florida consists of 67 established counties which each handle mental health differently as population strongly affects resources available to treat mental health conditions, including hospitals, private practices and school resources. This project explores the number of hospitalizations that are the result of mental health concerns in each county 1998-2017. Explore the graph below by hovering over different colored lines- what does your county do over time?
